## Description

A website companion to the Nombolo App, this website is designed to display Response videos to Asks that users have provided around the world. For example, a user might ask "how busy is the grocery store?" and drop that Ask at the local New Seasons. Another user would answer with a video reply "Not too bad today!". The website is not designed to mirror the app functionality, but rather provide a preview that drives downloads of the app where users can Ask/Post.

## Key Features

- Search by keyword in description to show responses to related Asks
- Easy to use Navigation Bar
- FAQ section
- Easy download of App
- Ambassador Program section


- Cross platform
 - Windows, macOS and Linux ready. Mobile responsive (improvements to mobile experience coming soon!)
